Apocalypse
===================
####Apocalypse is a simple zombie survival puzzle game.

###How To Play 
Run **dist/Apocalypse.jar** to execute game binary.

Move your human (green) to the extraction point (grey), and dodge the zombies (red). Avoid zombies' line of sight (yellow) if you can. If a zombie becomes alerted, it will more faster. Although a zombie might jump over you when alerted in point blank range, so you can use it to your advantage.

###Code
Code is still in a primal and loosely-prepared state, it was written for a workshop that did not run for its full duration. We will attempt to finalise it in the future. At the moment, proceed with caution.
